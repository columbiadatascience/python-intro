CDSS Education Events

This is the introductory Python series. Here, you will find notebooks on Python basics as well as a first look at working with data in Python. More materials will be added as tutorials progress over the semester. 

Note: We use Anaconda (python 3.5) and ipython notebooks for the tutorials. 

Check out our other repos for more advanced topics or tutorials on R!
